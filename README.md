# Push_swap

Sorting data on a stack with precision, efficiency, and minimal moves â€” this is the essence of the "Push_swap" project. With a limited set of instructions at your disposal, you'll delve into the world of sorting algorithms, strategically selecting and implementing the most efficient solutions for optimized data sorting.

## Introduction

In the realm of data sorting and manipulation, "Push_swap" masterins the art of stack-based sorting. This project challenged me to orchestrate sequences of moves that result in perfectly organized data, all while adhering to the constraints of limited instructions and minimal steps.

## Key Concepts

- **Stack-Based Sorting:** Gain expertise in sorting data structures using stacks as the primary tool, honing your skills in efficient data organization.

- **Optimization:** Explore and implement various sorting algorithms, strategically choosing the most efficient approach for minimizing the number of moves.

- **Algorithmic Mastery:** Dive into the world of algorithms, as you analyze, adapt, and optimize your sorting strategies for diverse datasets.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C compiler (e.g., GCC)

### Installation

1. Clone the Push_swap repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Nicktvdd/push_swap.git
```

2. Build the Push_swap executable:

```
cd push_swap
make
```

### Usage

Run the Push_swap sorting tool:

```
./push_swap [list_of_numbers]
```

Replace `[list_of_numbers]` with the numbers you want to sort. Watch in awe as Push_swap orchestrates the perfect sequence of moves to achieve sorted bliss.
